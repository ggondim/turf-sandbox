# Turf Sandbox

Playground environment allowing users to try out [Turf](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf)'s features and create (hopefully)
 easy to debug examples for issues they encountered using any Turf package.<br>
The app is currently hosted at [turf-sandbox.herokuapp.com](https://turf-sandbox.herokuapp.com).

### Usage

Write your code on the editor and return a valid GeoJSON object, it will be rendered on the map
 on the right.

### TODOs

- [ ] Add package selection

- [ ] Allow the user to save code snippets and create links to share the examples

- [ ] Add instructions on how to use the tool

- [ ] Evaluate strategies to improve system security
